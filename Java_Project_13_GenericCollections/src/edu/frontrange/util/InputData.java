/**
 * Class to input lines of values from a given file or resource.
 * <p>
 * Given the name of the file or resource from which to input lines of values, the
 * values on the lines are found delimited by a given regular expressions, and
 * returned in an array of String values. </p>
 * <p>
 * An iterator is defined to iterate over the lines. Each line of the file is
 * returned in the form of an array of Strings. Example of such a file is a "csv"
 * (comma-separated-value) file. End-on-line is always treated as an acceptable
 * delimiter. </p>
 * <p>
 * The content of the files is as defined for Java sources files, allowing Unicode
 * escapes. Further, if enabled, a character escaped with reverse slash is returned
 * "as-is" (and cannot be recognized as being part of a delimiting sequence), and if
 * a line separator is immediately preceded by a reverse slash, then that line
 * separator is ignored (including any following white space). This processing is
 * enabled by default.</p>
 * <p>
 * Blank lines are ignored, as are, if enabled, comments introduced by the defined
 * character(s) and terminated by a line separator (or end-of-file). By default,
 * this is enabled, and the comment character is "#". (Use null to disable comment
 * processing). </p>
 * <p>
 * End-of-line may be any of the Unicode characters carriage return, line feed,
 * carriage return followed by line feed, vertical tab, form feed, next line (0x85),
 * line separator (0x2028), or paragraph separator (0x2029). </p>
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 * <pre><code>    InputData source1 = InputData(inStream, null, 0, ":|,|;")</code></pre>
 * <p>will set up reading from an <strong>InputStream</strong> referenced by
 * {@code inStream}, in the default encoding of ISO-8859-1, with any number of
 * values on the line, which may be separated by ":" or "," or ";".</p>
 * <pre><code>    InputData source2 = InputData("xyz", this.getClass(), "UTF-8", 3, ",", ",", ";")</code></pre>
 * <p>will set up reading from a resource (file) named "xyz" in the same package as
 * this class, in the encoding of UTF-8, with three values on each line, the first
 * two of which are separated by "," and the last terminated by ";". If the resource
 * is some other package, say, containing a class <strong>ABC</strong>, then the
 * package may be selected by specifying <strong>ABC.class</strong>.</p>
 * <pre><code>    InputData source3 = InputData("myFile", null, null, 5, ",")</code></pre>
 * <p>will set up reading from a file named "myFile" (which will be found in the
 * CWD), in the default encoding of ISO-8859-1, with five values on each line, each
 * of which are separated by "," and the last either terminated by another "," or by
 * the end-of-line.</p>
 * <p>In all cases, the iterator will, with the use of the method {@code next}, return
 * an array of <strong>String</strong> values (<em>i.e.</em>, a type
 * <strong>String[]</strong>), with the values from each line. The most convenient
 * way to process these values is to allow the compiler to set up the iteration
 * using an "enhanced loop" of the form (where {@code source} is the reference
 * to the <strong>InputData</strong> instance):</p>
 * <pre><code>    for( String[] values : source ) { ... } </code></pre>
 * <p>or to use the {@code forEach} method of the iterator with a lambda expression,
 * in the form: </p>
 * <pre><code>    source.forEach((String[] values) -&gt; { ... }); </code></pre>
